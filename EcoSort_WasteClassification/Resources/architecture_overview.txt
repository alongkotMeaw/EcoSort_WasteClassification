Web App (Flask)
  - Loads ResNet50 fold checkpoints
  - Averages softmax probabilities per class
  - Applies tuned thresholds (Resources/class_thresholds.json)
  - Maps to waste bins (Recyclable, General, Biodegradable, Hazardous, Ewaste)
  - Serves HTML UI with camera/upload support

Outputs
  - Confusion matrices and CSV logs per fold
  - Ensemble predictions for user-uploaded images
