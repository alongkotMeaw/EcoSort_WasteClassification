# EcoSort Waste Classification

EcoSort Waste Classification is an ensemble-based computer vision project that
identifies 21 fine-grained waste subclasses and maps them to five household bin
categories (Recyclable, General, Biodegradable, Hazardous, and E-waste). The
system combines ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B1 training pipelines with a Flask web
application that exposes real-time image upload and camera capture support.

## Highlights
- 21-class dataset covering common recyclable, general, biodegradable, hazardous, and electronic waste.
- ResNet50 5-fold ensemble deployed for inference with optional class-specific confidence thresholds.
- EfficientNet-B1 5-fold pipeline with inverse-frequency class weighting for complementary evaluation.
- Flask web UI with drag-and-drop uploads, camera capture, and contextual disposal guidance.
- Documentation and resources that summarise architecture decisions, tuned thresholds, and reference studies.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 (recommended for Torch 2.2.x compatibility)
- `pip` and a virtual environment tool such as `venv` or `conda`
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional but recommended for training)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (optional) for sharing the web demo outside the local network

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-account/EcoSort_WasteClassification.git
cd EcoSort_WasteClassification
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Flask Web App
1. Collect the five ResNet50 checkpoints (`best_model_fold1.pth` ... `best_model_fold5.pth`)
   and place them in `Code/webpage/web/model/`. Update the `MODEL_PATHS` constant in
   `Code/webpage/web/main/main.py` if you store them elsewhere.
2. (Optional) review the threshold configuration in `Code/webpage/web/main/class_thresholds.json`.
3. Start the app from the project root:
   ```bash
   python Code/webpage/web/main/main.py
   ```
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in a browser. The console also prints a LAN URL.
5. To expose the interface externally, launch ngrok in a second terminal:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

## Training Pipelines

### ResNet50 Ensemble
1. Point `DATA_DIR` in `Code/RestNet50/train/train_kfold_resnet50.py` to the
   directory that holds one folder per class (no need to pre-split the data).
2. Activate your environment and run:
   ```bash
   python Code/RestNet50/train/train_kfold_resnet50.py
   ```
3. Outputs include:
   - `best_model_fold{n}.pth` checkpoints
   - `log_folds/fold{n}_log.csv` training history
   - `conf_matrix_fold{n}.png` per-fold confusion matrices

### EfficientNet-B1 Weighted Ensemble
1. Update the `DATA_DIR` constant in
   `Code/EfficientB0/train/train_kfold_log_b3_mixup_weighted.py` to the same
   single dataset directory.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python Code/EfficientB0/train/train_kfold_log_b3_mixup_weighted.py
   ```
3. Per-fold checkpoints, logs, and confusion matrices are written to
   `Code/EfficientB0/output/`.

### Ensemble Evaluation
Use `Code/EfficientB0/train/test_ensemble_efficientnet.py` to evaluate the
EfficientNet ensemble on the hold-out `test/` split and generate reports:
```bash
python Code/EfficientB0/train/test_ensemble_efficientnet.py
```

## Threshold Tuning & UI Behaviour
- `Code/webpage/web/main/class_thresholds.json` holds class-level probability
  thresholds. When a prediction exceeds its threshold it is considered confident
  enough to display; otherwise the system falls back to the highest probability.
- `Code/webpage/web/main/tuned_thresholds.py` is an alternative Flask entry point
  with Thai localisation for waste group labels and detailed probability tables.
- Waste subclasses are mapped to bin categories through the `GROUPS` structure
  inside `Code/webpage/web/main/main.py`, which in turn surfaces tips drawn from
  `Code/webpage/web/main/info_txt/`.

## Dataset Expectations
```
dataset_root/
  AluminumCan/
    img001.jpg
    ...
  Battery/
    ...
  ...
```
All folders should contain RGB images. ResNet50 scripts resize inputs to
224x224, while EfficientNet scripts resize to 260x260. Augmentations include
random horizontal flip, colour jitter, and ImageNet normalisation. Optionally,
you can keep aside a held-out test split to run `test_ensemble_efficientnet.py`
or other evaluations after cross-validation.
